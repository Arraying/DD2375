# Apple M1 Matrix Multiplication Benchmarks

Repository for software for a research project aiming to answer the research question:
> What is the computational performance (in FLOP/s) and power usage (in W) of single-precision matrix-matrix multiplication on an Apple M1 SoC using pure CPU, CPU accelerators, and GPU?

Kind thanks to the open-source repositories supporting this research:
* Some Metal shaders from: https://github.com/bkvogel/metal_performance_testing
* The OpenMP block multiplication implementation from: https://github.com/dmitrydonchenko/Block-Matrix-Multiplication-OpenMP
